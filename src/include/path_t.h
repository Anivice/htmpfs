/*
 *  _custom_it_t is a customized unidirectional iterator supporting traditional C for() loop
 *  and C++ 11 for() loop.
 *
 *  'list' and 'ring'
 *  at_eol is marked when we are at the end of the list,
 *  at_end is marked when we are at the end of the ring
 *  for explanation for 'list' and 'ring', please read 'iterator list' section
 *
 *  member 'current':
 *  _custom_it_t uses member 'current' rather than 'this' to pinpoint current list location. this way,
 *  a non-pointer object can be self-incremented to next location of the list.
 *
 *  iterator list:
 *  [ROOT ITERATOR], [1st OBJECT], ..., [n-th OBJECT], [EOL]
